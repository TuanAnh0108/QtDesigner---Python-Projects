  ### Definition of Problem
     
   I am developing a food management system for Mr. Ignijic. He is a client, seeing as he has quite a lot of food due to he goes to supermarket every week. Moreover, his foods somtimes is steal by some people in his house. From this, he usually uses papers to write down what he has but sometimes he does not carefully stored it so it is lost or he needs to spend much time to find where it is. Also, when he want to change the information about the food like the quantity, experation day, he needs to rewrite everything. This inconvenience makes him feel uncomfortable and waste his time. Moreover, because he goes to supermarket ever week, so he has such a large amount of food, so he has to write a lot, uses many papers and he usually has to empty his storage. Through this, I help him to develop a food management system to keep track of his food.
  
  ### Proposed solution
  
   The food management system is feasible to make. I decided to use Python language to develop the system. The Python language is 2nd ranking popular and widely-used programming language. Also, the Python language is really concise, expressive and close to human thinking. The project centers around **technical feasibility**, using only Python, making that aspect simple and not concerning. The Python language can run well on many types of operating systems such as Windows, MacOS, Linux. Furthermore, the program just requires medium to low - performance computer to execute. This also makes the **economic feasibility** of the system is feasible due to the user just only need to spend money on purchasing the program, cheap hardware such as keyboard, mouse and training how to use the program. He also has the computer to operate it so it is not a big duel. The **operational feasibility** is also done due to the program is relatively simple to use, after short training the user can confidently use it without facing any difficulties. The **schedule** of the project denpends on the experience of the user, however, for building the program, it only takes 1 week to build it and training the user. Moreover, it will take less than haf a week for user to input all the food he has. In overall, this programm is realistic and easily developed.
 
   ### Success Criteria
  
  ① The program has the log in, security system that only the user can access
  
  ② The new food can be added
  
  ③ The food properties, information such as name, experation date, money spend on that food can be edited
  
  ④ The food information can be stored in the database
  
  ⑤ The food can be deleted 
  
  ⑥ A finding function helping user to easily find the food information
  
  ⑦ A summary dialog to summerize the quantity, price of the food
  
  ⑧ The information of the food is shown in a table
  
  ⑨ There is also log out button to help user close the app
