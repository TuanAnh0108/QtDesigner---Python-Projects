**You have been given 5000 USD to build your dream computer. The only condition is that you cannot buy a prebuilt computer. Describe what parts you would buy, and Explain how they work as a system to create a computer.**

Firstly, I definitely buy a CPU (Central Processing Unit) with $70, which is described as the "brain" of a computer. The CPU's main function is to take input from a peripheral (keyboard, mouse, printer, etc) or computer program, and interpret what it needs. The CPU then either outputs information to your monitor or performs the peripheral's requested task. The second thing that is essential for building a PC is motherboard with 250$.It holds together many of the crucial components of a computer, including the central processing unit (CPU), memory and connectors for input and output devices. Then, Storage is also an important part to save the data. Next, to make the computer work, I need case, fans, and power supply. And Finally, I will buy hardware such as Keyboard, Mouse, Monitor for the input information.
