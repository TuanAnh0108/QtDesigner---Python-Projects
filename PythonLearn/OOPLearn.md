**1.What's a class**
  
  *)A class is a code template for creating objects. Objects have member variables and have behaviour associated with them

**2.What's an instance**
  
  *) An individual object of a certain class

**3.What's the relationship between a class and an instance**

   

**4.What's the Python syntax used for defining a new class**
  
  We use the class keyword to define a new class
  
**5.What's the spelling convention for a class name**

  It should be lowercase and space is underscore.

**6.How do you instantiate, or create an instance of, a class**
  
  To instantiate a class, simply call the class as if it were a function, passing the arguments that the __init__() method requires. The return value will be the newly created object.

**7.How do you access the attributes and behaviours of a class instance?**

  We access the attributes and behaviours of a class by using the dotted-syntax. 

**8.What's a method?**

  A method is a function that “belongs to” an object

**9.What's the purpose of *self***
  
  The self is used to represent the instance of the class. With this keyword, you can access the attributes and methods of the class in python. It binds the attributes with the given arguments

**10.What's the purpose of the __int__ method?**
 
  it allows the class to initialize the attributes of the class.
  
**11.Describe how inheritance helps prevent code duplication.**

  
**12.Can child classes override properties of their parents?**

  n the same way that the child class can have its own properties and methods, it can override the properties and methods of the parent class.
