  I am going to design a Food Inventory software for my client. With the software, you can easily keep track of the information about the food: the expiration day, the quantity, the last used the food, the location,... 
  Moreover, you can also add the information of new food into the program and delete the one that you do not want to keep track.Finally, there is a security system that only you can access it through your password and username.
