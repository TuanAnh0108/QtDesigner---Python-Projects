The food management system is feasible to make. I decided to use Python language to develop the system. The Python language is 2nd ranking popular and widely-used programming language. Also, the Python language is really concise, expressive and close to human thinking. The project centers around **technical feasibility**, using only Python, making that aspect simple and not concerning. The Python language can run well on many types of operating systems such as Windows, MacOS, Linux. Furthermore, the program just requires medium to low - performance computer to execute. This also makes the **economic feasibility** of the system is feasible due to the user just only need to spend money on purchasing the program, cheap computer and training how to use the program. He also has the computer to operate it so it is not a big duel. The **operational feasibility** is also done due to the program is relatively simple to use, after training the user can confidently use it without facing any difficulties. The **schedule** of the project denpends on the experience of the user, however, for building the program, it only takes 1 week to build it and training the user. Moreover, it will take less than haf a week for user to input all the food he has. In overall, this programm is realistic and easily developed.
