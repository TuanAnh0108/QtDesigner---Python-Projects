The food management system is feasible to make. I decided to use Python language to develop the system. The python is a easy  language to use and does not require advanced level to use it. With the basic level of Python, you can easily build a program effeciently. The project centers around **technical feasibility**, using only Python, making that aspect simple and not concerning. This also makes the **economic feasibility** of the system is feasible due to the user just only need to spend money on purchasing the program and training how to use it. He also has the computer to operate it so it is not a big duel. The **operational feasibility** is also done due to the program is relatively simple to use, after training the user can confidently use it without facing any difficulties. The **schedule** of the project denpends on the experience of the user, however, for building the program, it only takes 1 week to build it and training the user. Moreover, it will take less than haf a week for user to input all the food he has. In overall, this programm is realistic and easily developed.
