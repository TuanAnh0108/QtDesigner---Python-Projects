  ### Expected input and output
  
  #|Function|INPUT|OUTPUT
---|---|---|---
1| ADD FOOD | Name, Location, Quantity, Expiration, Price of Food|Data in the Databse file and in the food data table
2| EDIT FOOD | Name and properties of food need to be editted | New data in the Database file and in the food data table

4| SEARCH FOOD | The name of the food | All the properties of the food will be shown in a table
5| DELETE FOOD | The name of the food | All the properties of the food included name of the food will be deleted from the database file and also the food data table

  ### Testing plan
  
  Due to the output data can be shown after using the functions, so that we can test the program by using using the program and look at the place where the output will be. This can be done right after finishing the code and by the user in the progress of using the program.
