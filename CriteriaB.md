5| DELETE FOOD | The name of the food | All the properties of the food included name of the food will be deleted from the database file and also the food data table

  ### Testing plan
  
  Due to the output data can be shown after using the functions right in the app, so that we can test the program by using using the program and look at the place where the output will be. This can be done right after finishing the code and by the user in the progress of using the program.
